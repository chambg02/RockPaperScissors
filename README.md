# RockPaperScissors

Details:
  Completed on 1/05/2022 by chambg02 as part of the Foundations part of The Odin Project.

Inspiration:
  Theme based on preference for dark mode and simplicity. 

Note for future/to reader:
  - The code doesn't actually stop running once a winner reaches 5, the text simply stops updating. Could be improved.
  - Design of the header could do with improvement.
  - I once heard that Apple had to rewrite their "shuffle" function on iPods because people complained it did not feel random (lots of repetition of songs). Having seen how this random selector behaves, I now understand.
